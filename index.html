            <h1>This is Me! Marcus Timothy Thalla Ureta</h1>
            <p> Hello! I'm Marcus Timothy Thalla Ureta, a programming student from CIIT always looking to learn more. I was born on October 28, 2007. I'm very enthusiastic about programming, I always give my best when I need to program, as to me that's when I can truly express myself. To me, programming is one very creative and logical creative thinking process, and I strive to always solve that mystery. To prove this, you can scroll through my portofolio site to see all my achievements that I've accomplished throughout my journey in CIIT.</p>
