            <h1>My Early Life</h1>
            <p>I was born on October 28, 2007, I'm a fully Filipino person living on planet Earth! Whilst I don't recall my early life that well, I do remember my Kindergarten years throughout my High School years. In my Kindergarten-Grade 6, I was in Claret School of Quezon City, during my time there I was very introverted during that time, but nonetheless I think I had learned a lot from my time then. Next, is my high school years, during my Grade 7-10 period, I was at an online school because of the pandemic during the time, this time was also quite boring to me however I did get an itch to become more sociable by Grade 9. So when Grade 10 came, I came out of my comfort zone and started to become more socially active with everyone, whilst Grade 10 was a "special" period for me, I think I can say I'm happy and enjoyed my experience. Now I'm at a Senior High School learning programming, which is something I've always wanted to work towards up until now, let's see how this story unfolds!</p>

I also used to video edit before for my youtube channel, however I don't do videos anymore. I often exercise to make sure I'm fit and healthy. And then I've recently picked up Pixel Art Drawing to make art for my game.</p>
